## Module 0:
This was an introductory module, and it taught me how to set up my development environment for the course. I learned how to sign up for a LangSmith account and generate an API key, cloning the course's GitHub repository, creating a Python virtual environment, and installing the necessary dependencies. I learned how to configure my environment variables by creating a .env file to store my LangSmith and OpenAI API keys, preparing the environment to run the course notebooks using Jupyter. Finally, I ran a Jupyter Notebook, which showed a simple application of RAG. I modified it, and tried my own example.
